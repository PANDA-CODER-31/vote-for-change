## Introduction:
Upon observing the ongoing election process going through in India, we saw several loose ends which we tried to fix with our prototype E-ADMINISTRATION.
The world's biggest democracy needs to have a fair election in which every citizen of the country takes part. As the preamble of the constitution says “BY THE PEOPLE,FOR THE PEOPLE AND TO THE PEOPLE .” ,same goes for elections. Voting is done by the people to elect the candidates to work for them.
With our idea we plan to have 100% voting rates in INDIA in the near future, so that world’s largest democracy is the best democracy.
Voting through online medium is one of the proposed solutions, where user can submit their vote at their fingertips through their devices. This would not only save time and energy of the voters but also money to the government. Not only will it be convenient to the public but also it will be a chaos free election.
The voting rate of INDIA is very low since people can’t travel to their hometowns to cast their vote. Our E-ADMINISTRATION prototype will be a permanent solution to this problem. Taking account of the diversity of languages used in INDIA we have enabled an option to switch between languages which is convenient to the user.
